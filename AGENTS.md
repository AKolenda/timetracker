# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

## Release verification

Before pushing any change intended for production, run a mobile viewport test at a phone-sized width (390px or equivalent). Confirm that the key changed screen renders, has no horizontal overflow, and has no browser console errors. Do not push until this verification has passed; report any limitation, such as missing local credentials or data, before requesting release approval.
